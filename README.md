# JS Sorting Algorithms 🔥

A project consisting of various _sorting algorithms_ and their use cases.

## Features ✨

- ## Bubble sort 🫧

  **File**: [bubble.mjs](./js-bubble-sort/bubble.mjs)

  **Bubble sort** is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

- ## Insertion sort 🍆

  **File**: [insertion.mjs](./js-insertion-sort/insertion.mjs)

  **Insertion sort** is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. It repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

- ## Selection sort 💪

  **File**: [selection.mjs](./js-selection-sort/selection.mjs)

  **Selection sort** is a popular sorting algorithm where lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Molestias quibusdam enim, deserunt eaque perspiciatis tempora voluptatibus reiciendis ea unde eum.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/BeanyTheCoder/js-sorting-algorithms.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd  js-sorting-algorithms`

3. Navigate to any child directory using `cd`
4. Open `script.js` using any text editor of your choice
5. Run the file using either
   _Quokka.js_ or _Node.js_ (instructions for both in project file)

## Usage 🚀

There is a `random.mjs` file in the parent directory. It contains the code for generating a sequence of random numbers used for demos

It(and all other JS files here) use the `.mjs` extension so that module exports and imports are functional when using `npm`

If using `Quokka.js` extension, note that the free version does not support module imports, so you may simply copy over the code from `random.mjs` or use `npm` to run files

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- JavaScript
- _Quokka.js_ & _Node.js_

## Roadmap 🗺️

In the future, I plan to implement:

- Merge sort 👍
- Quicksort 😍
- Bogosort 🤣

And more. Please leave feedback and give suggestions on what algos I should add next
